## About

This project is an immersive journey into creating a dynamic Blog Application with real-time capabilities using the Spring framework. It encompasses a wide array of concepts and tools, including Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), and MySQL database.

## Features

- Build robust CRUD REST API's for efficient data management.
- Implement Pagination, Sorting, and Search/Filter functionalities for enhanced user experience.
- Establish secure Login/Sign-in and Signup functionality with Spring Security, JWT, and role-based authorization.
- Utilize Lombok and DTO's for streamlined code and data handling.
- Handle exceptions and validations in Spring Boot REST APIs.
- Explore In-memory and Database authentication and authorization strategies.
- Implement one-to-many and many-to-many JPA mappings for complex data relationships.
- Test REST APIs using Postman and document them with Swagger UI.
- Version REST APIs using industry-standard strategies.
- Customize Swagger documentation with annotations.
- Manage profiles for deployment in different environments.
- Implement Transaction Management with Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.

## Technologies Used

- Securing REST APIs with Spring Security, JWT, and role-based authorization.
- Utilizing Lombok and DTOs for efficient code and data management.
- Handling exceptions and performing validations in Spring Boot REST APIs.
- Versioning REST APIs and documenting them using Swagger UI.
- Customizing Swagger documentation with annotations.
- Managing profiles for deployment in different environments.
- Deploying the Spring Boot Blog app on AWS cloud for production.
- Dockerizing Spring Boot applications and MySQL CRUD application.
